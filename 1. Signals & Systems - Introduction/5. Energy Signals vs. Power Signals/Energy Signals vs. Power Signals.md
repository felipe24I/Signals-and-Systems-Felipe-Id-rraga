# Energy Signals vs. Power Signals

# 1. Energy of a signal

**Definition=** Total energy is the integral (or sum) of the squared magnitude of the signal over all time. It quantifies the cumulative strength of the signal, where the 'strength' is the squared amplitude (energy is not linear in amplitude)

- **For continuous-time signals:**

  # $E= \int$
