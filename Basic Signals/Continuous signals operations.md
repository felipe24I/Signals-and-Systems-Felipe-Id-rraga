# Continuous signal operations

Continuous signals are fundamental in various fields, including signal processing, communications, and engineering. This document explores key operations that can be performed on continuous signals.

# 1. Superposition

# Definition

Superposition is a principle that states when two or more signals are combined, the resulting signal is the algebraic sum of the individual signals at each point in time.

# Mathematical Representation

For two continuous signals f(t) and g(t), the superposition operation is defined as:

$h(t)= f(t) + g(t)$

# Properties

- Linear operation

- Preserves the characteristics of individual signals

- Fundamental in linear system analysis

# Examples

- Combining audio signals

- Analyzing interference in wave systems

- Electronic circuit analysis

# Code example

```python

#import numpy as np
```
# 2. Temporal displacement

# 3. Scaling displacement
